# Financial Clarity Reporting

## Project Description
This project combines a business-facing Power BI e-commerce dashboard with a backend Python-based churn prediction model to deliver actionable insights into customer behavior and retention strategies.

Itâ€™s designed as an MVP to help e-commerce operators answer critical questions:
- Who are our best customers?
- When do customers usually reorder?
- Which customers are at risk of churning?
- How are ads performing across platforms?

The goal is to enable smarter marketing, increase customer lifetime value (LTV), and inform re-engagement campaigns â€” all powered by accessible data tools and AI

## Features
ðŸ“Š Power BI Dashboard
- Revenue & Orders Overview: Track sales, AOV, and order volume over time
- Customer Segmentation: Break down New, Active, and Churned customers
- Reorder Behavior Heatmap: Visualize time until next order
- Ad Spend Analysis: Compare performance by platform (Spend, ROAS, CAC)
- Profitability Snapshot: Real-time margins, net revenue, and LTV

ðŸ¤– Churn Prediction Model (Python)
- Labels customers as New, Active, or Churned based on behavior
- Engineers features like AOV, order frequency, days since last order
- Trains a Random Forest classifier to predict churn probability
- Outputs scores for all customers with confidence levels
- Visualizes churn distribution and feature importance
